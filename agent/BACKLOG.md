# BACKLOG — pre-approved small tasks for idle executor time

Maintained by the coordinator (Claude). The executor pulls items
top-down **only** when the main `agent/TASK-*.md` queue is empty, and
reports each pulled item in its report file.

## Item format

```
- [ ] <ID> — <one-line objective> — accept: <command or check> — size: <S/M/L>
```

**Closing an item moves the whole block.** Every continuation line of a
bullet belongs to that bullet: either move the whole block into `## Done`
and collapse it to one `- [x]` line, or delete the whole block and write
the `- [x]` line. Deleting only a bullet's first line leaves orphaned
prose in the queue — that happened on 09.09 and the coordinator repaired
it by hand.

## Queue

Refilled by the coordinator 10.09.2026 after accepting TASK-14…18.
Every item is small, pre-approved, and independent of the M8 lanes.
A parallel lane may take one **only inside its own zone** (ADR-0012 §2).

- [ ] B19 — `rusterm markets --json` for machine consumption — accept:
  `python3 -m rusterm.cli markets --json | python3 -m json.tool` parses,
  test asserts every registry field present — size: S
- [ ] B20 — a `Market` row whose provider module is absent must never
  reach `RequestGate` — accept: test asserts `ConfigError`, zero
  requests counted — size: S
- [ ] B21 — `import --dry-run`: extract and verify, write nothing —
  accept: test asserts database sha256 unchanged — size: S
- [ ] B22 — document formats table in README from the code, not by hand
  — accept: test asserts every format `extract.py` handles is listed —
  size: S
- [ ] B23 — `verify` counts near-misses (quote present, number
  reformatted) separately from outright failures — accept: test with a
  thousands-separator mismatch lands in the near-miss bucket — size: M
- [ ] B24 — per-host request counters surface in `doctor` — accept:
  test asserts each host's used/ceiling printed after a fake run —
  size: S
- [ ] B25 — golden payload size guard as a test, not a report line —
  accept: test fails when any `tests/data/<provider>/` exceeds 256 KB —
  size: S
- [ ] B26 — `manual_import_required` message is asserted to contain a
  command a user can copy verbatim — accept: test runs the printed
  string through the CLI parser — size: S
- [ ] B27 — a manual fact and a provider fact for the same concept and
  period coexist without either overwriting the other — accept: test
  asserts both rows present and the provider one wins the measure —
  size: M
